About Bruker Control
====================

Bruker Control is a system that unites the Bruker Ultima Investigator
multi-photon microscope's software Prairie View, Arduino sketches, and GENTL
compliant cameras through Python to produce structured datasets compatible with
the `Neurodata Without Borders <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ standard.

It has been written for use in `Professor Kay Tye's laboratory
<https://tyelab.org/>`_ at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies but may be
adopted by any lab that would like to perform similar experiments. It is under
a Mozilla Public License 2.0.

Check out the source code at the lab's `GitHub <https://github.com/Tyelab/headfix_control>`_.
